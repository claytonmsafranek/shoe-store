TODOs:
- refactor weld of fof creat-react-app onto vite

Alternatives to useEffect for HTTP calls
- Tanstack query
- swr (Vercel)
- Apollo
- Tanstack Router
- Remix
- Next.js with RSC

Notes:
- <ErrorBoundary /> only handles uncaught errors, if we are catching errors it will run that code first
    - We could use this as a last ditch effort in weld? Just for errors to bubble up should they not be caught at the source
- for shareable state, like wanting to share a url, store state in the url when possible
- you only want to lift state when a few components need to access the same state - lift to the lowest common component
- indexdb is better for lots of data and lots of read/writes
- local storage is good for small amounts of data and not too frequent read/writes, localstorage is a synchronous api so it will get slow if you are working with a lot of data
and we will see that the browser will lock and freeze up when it is accessing
- check out Ui.dev, they have a lot of public open source hooks (thye are all in the index.js file on their github repo)
