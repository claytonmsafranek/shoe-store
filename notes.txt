TODOs:
- refactor weld of fof creat-react-app onto vite

Alternatives to useEffect for HTTP calls
- Tanstack query
- swr (Vercel)
- Apollo
- Tanstack Router
- Remix
- Next.js with RSC

Notes:
- <ErrorBoundary /> only handles uncaught errors, if we are catching errors it will run that code first
    - We could use this as a last ditch effort in weld? Just for errors to bubble up should they not be caught at the source
